sagepayForm-php
===============

A simple class to integrate sagepayForm v3.00 into your website. Still in early Beta, but since there is now sage php integration kit out yet - maybe useful for someone.

To get started change the protected field $encryptPassword and look into index.php for example form, success.php for example response parsing.
